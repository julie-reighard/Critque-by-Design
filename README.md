# Critque by Design - The U.S. Opioid Epidemic and Prescribing Practices
Original Visualization: [Prescribing Practices](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/prescribing/prescribing-practices.html)


I chose this visualization becuase I believe this is a serious problem in the United States and this graph does not show the gravity of the situation that has become an epidemic. Every year deaths from opioid overdoses increases, where opioid deaths can be attributed to both prescribed and nonprescribed drugs (herion). For opioids, issues usually begin from a prescription from a physician and spiral into a substance disorder that many Americans fall victim to.

The visualization provided by the CDC does a good job of shows the data from an informative standpoint but the information displayed can be unclear. For example, the two lines on the chart show information that can easily be misinterpreted.  The oragne iine displays "all opioids" which is total opioid prescriptions and the orange line shows high-dosage prescriptions, both of these are shown per 100 persons. While the Y-axis of 100 persons exemplifies how important this problem, it gives no furhter information. Intuitively, if you are displaying "high-dosage" I would imagine that "normal/low-doages" would be displayed as well. This idea informed my process whenever I was trying to revisualize this data. 

I started by creating wireframs that showed the data as bar charts to understand the difference between how many perople are being prescribed normal v. hgih doses of opioids, where the entire bar would show total prescriptions per 100 persons rather than a line. This critque was useful to more clearly show how the high dosage prescriptions have decreased throughout the years. This makes sense as well because it is more initutive to think that as all the presctiptions are decreasing, both of the categories within the total are decreasing consistently throughout the years. Another aspect of the original chart that I thought was important to change was that x-axis with the years, on the CDC's chart, the axis was crowded when they showed the entire data "dd/mm/yyyy". Since all of the dates are the same, it makes more sense and makes the chart less cluttered to just include the year. 

I included a second graph to show the total number of prescriptions every year, breaking them down by high and normal doses. Within each dot, the deaths are shown when you hover over, it shows the number of deaths due to opioids that year. I found this hard to visualize becuase the proportion of deaths is .01% of each prescription. I made a dual-axis chart that was very decieving because it appeared that the deaths were similar to the prescriptions. However, I did find it important to include deaths becuase it adds emotion to the story and puts it into perspective of why the opioid epidemic is such an important issue to focus on. Additionally, it shows the effect of overprescribing where you can infer the long-term affects of overprescribing overtime. For example, an increase in deaths over the years where someone has been struggling with addiction for years. While there has been a decrease in prescribing over the years, those who are lose prescrptions resort to street drug substitutes.
